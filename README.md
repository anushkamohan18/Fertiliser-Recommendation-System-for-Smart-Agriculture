# Fertiliser Recommendation System for Smart Agriculture

This project is a Fertiliser Recommendation System designed for smart agriculture applications. Built using Jupyter Notebook, the system leverages data analysis and machine learning to suggest the most suitable fertiliser based on various soil and crop parameters. The goal is to help farmers optimize crop yield, reduce costs, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Fertiliser Recommendations:** Suggests optimal fertilisers based on soil, crop, and environmental data.
- **Data-driven Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate and tailored suggestions.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, allowing users to input parameters and obtain instant recommendations.
- **Visualization:** Provides clear graphs and charts for data analysis and insights.
- **Open Source:** Fully open for contributions and improvements.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Input:** The user provides soil properties (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels), crop type, and environmental data.
2. **Data Processing:** The system cleans and preprocesses the input data.
3. **Prediction:** The trained machine learning model predicts the most suitable fertiliser type and quantity.
4. **Result Output:** Recommendations are displayed along with supporting visualizations.
